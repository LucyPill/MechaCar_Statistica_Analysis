# MechaCar_Statistica_Analysis

## Overview/Purpose:
AutosRUs want to move their decision making process into the 21st century. The data analytics team is in charged of performing retrospective analysis of historical data, analytical verification and validation of current automotive specfications and study design of future product testing.

The AutosRUs executive team recognizes that the most succesful automovile launches utilize data analytics in every decision making process;therefore, we must ensure that this analysis contains statistical backbone, a quantitative metric, and clear interpretation of the results in order to keep upper management happy and make good decisions.

We will use R programing language to do this analysis and provide the following:
1. Summary statistics for different variables
2. Visualization for diffrent datasets
3. Interpretation of the statistical test results

Finally, we will use our critical thinking skills to propose our own study design, hypothesis, and analysis workflow in order to make AutosRUs manufacturing process better.

## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables is the following:

mpg_data =  (6.267)vehicle_length + (1.245e-03)vehicle_weight + (6.877e-02)spoiler_angle + (3.546)ground_clearance + (-3.411)AWD - 104.0

### Let's take a look at the summary statistics: 

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* The two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg were the vehicle_length and the ground_clearance. These two variables as well as the slope are very significant in this model as we can see their p-values are very small.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* The slope (m) is not considered to be zero beacuse there is a significant relationship between some of independent variables (vehicle_length and the ground_clearance) the dependent variable.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
* Yes, it does. This regression model efectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes as it is indicated by the r-squared value of 0.7149. A r-squared of 1 would predict the model with a very high degree of certanty.

## Deliverable 2: Summary Statistic on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.

1. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
* Looking at the total_summary
