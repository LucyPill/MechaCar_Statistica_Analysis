# MechaCar_Statistica_Analysis

## Overview/Purpose:
AutosRUs want to move their decision making process into the 21st century. The data analytics team is in charged of performing retrospective analysis of historical data, analytical verification and validation of current automotive specfications and study design of future product testing.

The AutosRUs executive team recognizes that the most succesful automovile launches utilize data analytics in every decision making process;therefore, we must ensure that this analysis contains statistical backbone, a quantitative metric, and clear interpretation of the results in order to keep upper management happy and make good decisions.

We will use R programing language to do this analysis and provide the following:
1. Summary statistics for different variables
2. Visualization for diffrent datasets
3. Interpretation of the statistical test results

Finally, we will use our critical thinking skills to propose our own study design, hypothesis, and analysis workflow in order to make AutosRUs manufacturing process better.
